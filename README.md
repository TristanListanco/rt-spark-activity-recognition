# RT-Spark Activity Recognition

Laboratory Activity 3: a full-stack IoT system that classifies walking vs. running in real time.

The RT-Spark board streams accelerometer and gyroscope readings over Wi-Fi/MQTT to a cloud service. There, a small 1D-CNN classifies the activity and the result is stored in PostgreSQL. A Flask API serves the results to an Android app.

## Architecture

    FW --> WIFI["RW007 Wi-Fi"]
  end
  subgraph Cloud["Cloud VM (Docker Compose)"]
    MQ["Mosquitto broker"] --> CL["Classifier (ONNX 1D-CNN)"]

    DB --> API["Flask Web API"]
  end

  API -- "HTTP/JSON" --> APP["Android app (Kotlin + Volley)"]
```

Message formats, API endpoints and the database schema are in [docs/CONTRACTS.md](docs/CONTRACTS.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `firmware/` | RT-Thread project for the RT-Spark: IMU sampling, Wi-Fi, MQTT publishing |
| `cloud/` | Docker Compose stack: Mosquitto, PostgreSQL, classifier service, Flask API |
| `ml/` | Dataset exploration, preprocessing, training, exported ONNX model |
| `tools/` | `fake_publisher.py` (simulates the board), `record.py` (records labelled board data) |
| `app/` | Android app: live prediction and history |
| `docs/` | Interface contracts, ML report |

## Progress

- [x] M0: Repository set up
- [ ] M1: Local cloud stack (broker, DB, API stub, fake publisher)
- [ ] M1b: Firmware toolchain builds and flashes the stock BSP
